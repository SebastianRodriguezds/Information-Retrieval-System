# Information-Retrieval-System
Coursework Assessment Brief COMP1859-2024/25 Academic Session.

InnovateTech, a pioneering tech company at the forefront of innovation, is experiencing an
unprecedented period of growth. With its expanding workforce—now numbering in the hundreds—
spread across diverse departments, the Human Resources (HR) team finds itself grappling with an
overwhelming volume of employee data. As the company scales, the HR team faces significant
challenges in efficiently accessing and managing crucial information, including detailed employee
profiles, comprehensive performance reviews, and vital job application histories. Currently, the data is
fragmented and stored across a myriad of platforms and formats. Structured data, such as employee
records and payroll information, resides in traditional SQL databases, while unstructured data, including
resumes, email attachments, PDFs, and Word documents, lurks in various digital silos. This disarray
hampers the HR team’s ability to quickly retrieve essential information, leading to delays in decisionmaking
and a decline in overall operational efficiency.
Recognising the urgent need for improvement, the HR department has pinpointed the necessity for a
robust information retrieval (IR) system capable of seamlessly managing both structured and
unstructured data. The new system must not only enhance data retrieval capabilities but also facilitate
a smoother workflow for HR professionals, enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives rather than
getting bogged down by administrative inefficiencies. As a computing expert, your mission is to design
and develop a cutting-edge information retrieval system that caters specifically to InnovateTech’s HR
requirements. This system should incorporate advanced search algorithms and data indexing techniques
to ensure rapid and accurate data retrieval across multiple formats. Additionally, it must integrate
seamlessly with existing systems, providing a user-friendly interface that empowers HR professionals
to manage employee data efficiently and effectively. Your innovative solution will be key to
transforming how InnovateTech's HR department operates, fostering a more agile and data-driven
approach to workforce management.
